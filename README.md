# DemoProject
Just for demonstrating frameworks/tools (IN PROGRESS)

Main architecture develop with ECS framework (LeoEcsLite). Zenject is using just for injecting dependences in scene, 
on the other hand we can use built in Di container in LeoEcsLite framework for these case. 
In the project I'm using tools like DotWeen, Cinemachine, ObiRope, UniRx and UniTask.
